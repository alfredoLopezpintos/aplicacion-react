## Code review dynamics

Every contributor will have to agree on merging new changes. Some contributions may not be agreed upon github platform itelsef.

## Git merge strategy

We will always merge to `develop` first. And when it's ready, to the `main` branch. Avoiding merging as possible.

We will be using the "Recursive" merge strategy, where we won't work on the `main` branch until the app is ready to production.
The work flow will be divided on the `feature` branch, for each feature we are working on; for later merging it to the `develop`
branch, where all the features will be united and, finally, merging to `main`.

## Pull Request Process

### To start coding a new feature, you must create a new local branch:

    git flow feautre start nameNewFeature

### Once finish coding the new feature, itâ€™s time to push the new branch to the GitHub repository:

    git push --set-upstream origin feature/nameNewFeature
